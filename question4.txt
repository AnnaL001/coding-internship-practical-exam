The user interacts with the view containing a form in which the user is to input their first name and 
second name and changes the data(model) which in turn causes the controller(studentController that is defined by use of
ng-controller directive) to be invoked. The controller modifies the data based on the user's request, interacts with servers 
via services and performs CRUD operations on the data. Changes in the data is detected by AngularJS and AngularJS updates 
the view by way of a two-way data binding
